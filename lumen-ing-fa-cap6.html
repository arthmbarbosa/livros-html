						<p class="general-text">In the 21st century, it is no longer easy to function in the world without the
							English language. Whether it is for political reasons, for work purposes, for entertainment, for
							traveling, or for accessing information and culture, it is omnipresent in the contemporary world: as a
							fundamental communication tool in important organizations such as the United Nations (UN); in sports
							events like the Olympics or the FIFA World Cup; in education and academic environments (since the majority
							of the scientific publications is written in English); and also on a daily basis. </p>
						<p class="general-text">Let’s think about Brazil. When taking a walk around a big city, we may notice how
							the language is spread all around, on shop windows, in the names of stores and restaurants, outdoors, car
							stickers, T-shirt sayings, sports names, song lyrics, and magazines titles at newsstands. Additionally,
							this global language is part of the population’s routine, on videogames, movies, TV shows, social
							networks, business expressions, slangs and idiomatic expressions, and so on.</p>
						<p class="general-text">In order to avoid serious communication breakdowns, you must not only be familiar
							with the structure and functions of the language, but also care for the non-verbal communication and
							cultural manifestations that come along with the language, because these elements show you a lot about the
							language itself.</p>

						<h3 class="titulo2">
							Use
						</h3>
						<p class="general-text">The Simple Past and the Past Continuous help us to show how two past actions or
							situations were connected. We use these two tenses together to indicate that the Simple Past action
							happened in the middle of the Past Continuous action, while it was in progress.</p>
						<p class="general-text">
							We use the Past Continuous to show a continuing (long) action being interrupted by a short past action.
							When forming sentences, we use
							<b>was / were + verb + ing</b>
							in the independent clause and the
							<b>Simple Past</b>
							in the dependent clause. The order may vary, but if we start the sentence with a dependent clause, we must
							use a comma.
						</p>
						<p class="general-text">
							Look at the examples:
						</p>
						<center>
							<img class="img-md" src="./assets/img/toby_was.png"></img>
						</center>

						<p class="general-text">It is good to know that some verbs are commonly used to express short actions, and
							if you memorize them it will be easier to identify if a sentence needs the Past Continuous or the Simple
							Past. Some of these verbs are: call, ring, arrive, land, hit and go out.</p>

						<h3 class="titulo2">Parallel actions</h3>
						<p class="general-text">
							When you use the Past Continuous with two actions in the same sentence, it expresses the idea that both
							actions were happening at the same time.

						<h3 class="titulo2">When and while</h3>
						<p class="general-text">
							Clauses are groups of words which have meaning, but are often not complete sentences. Some clauses take
							the word
							<b>when,</b>

						<h3 class="titulo3">When</h3>
						<p class="general-text">
							We use
							<b>when</b>
							to introduce a single completed event that takes place in the middle of a longer activity. In these cases,
							<b>when</b>
							is usually followed by the Simple Past:
						</p>
						</p>
						<center>
							<img class="img-md" src="./assets/img/the_doctor.png"></img>

						<h3 class="titulo3">While</h3>
						<p class="general-text">
