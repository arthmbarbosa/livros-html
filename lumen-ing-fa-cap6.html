						<p class="general-text">
							The Oxford Dictionary defines behold as “to see or observe someone or something, especially of
							remarkable or impressive nature.” We are flooded by billions of sensory impulses all the time and that is
							how we interpret the world. Our attention and interpretation determine what we believe in. The way we see
							the history facts, the natural disasters, the human social transformations and the technological changes
							that
							have taken place on the planet so far affects us in some way. </p>
						<p class="general-text">
							For example, if we looked at the homeless people as we walked by the street, and tried to put ourselves
							in their shoes and understand their situation, instead of judging, we could attempt to interfere in a
							positive
							way. We could decide to do volunteer work or call the social assistance.</p>
						<p class="general-text">
							With the world moving in such a fast pace, it is only natural that we look at things but don’t really see
							them, and we may forget that paying attention to what happened in the past, and still happens currently
							around us, is what keeps the world going around. Whatever we learned, saw, and experienced through life
							tends to have a strong impact on our behavior. Being able to select and apply the learnings to our lives
							will
							bring us the chance to grow and evolve. Behold the best and become the finest, this way you can influence
							people and turn into an object of transformation to those around you.</p>

							<h3 class="titulo1">Simple Past tense </h3>
						</div>

						<p class="general-text">

							As we studied before, the Simple Past (also called past simple, past indefinite or preterit) is a verb
							tense which is used to show that a completed action took place at a specific time in the past. The simple
							past is also frequently used to talk about past habits and generalizations.
						</p>
						<h3 class="titulo2">
							Simple Past tense forms
						</h3>

						<h3 class="titulo3">Affirmative form</h3>
						<p class="general-text">The structure for the affirmative form is usually:</p>
						<img class="img-full-width" src="./assets/img/Subject_verb.png" />

						<h3 class="titulo3">Negative form</h3>
						<p class="general-text">The structure for the negative form is usually:</p>
						<img class="img-full-width" src="./assets/img/subject_did.png" />
						<h3 class="titulo3">
							Interrogative form
						</h3>
						<p class="general-text">The structure for the yes / no questions is usually:</p>
						<img class="img-full-width" src="./assets/img/did_subject.png" />

						<h3 class="titulo3">Wh questions</h3>
						<p class="general-text">The structure for the Wh questions is usually:</p>
						<img class="img-full-width" src="./assets/img/question_word.png" />

						<h3 class="titulo2">The emphatic “did”</h3>
						<p class="general-text">Emphasizing what you say or write helps you make your message clearer, and it is
							very common and natural. You can use the words “do”, “does”, and “did” to put emphasis on a statement. For
							the Simple Past, we use the auxiliary verb “did”. This form of emphasis can be used when we’re
							contradicting what someone is saying in a conversation or when we’re being emotive. It is important to
							notice that when using “did” for emphasis the following verb remains in the base form. </p>
						<p class="general-text">Take the following examples: </p>
						<li class="general-text">
							<i>Come on! Samuel did learn about indigenous culture in Acre. He told me that. • </i>
						</li>
						<li class="general-text">
							<i>The past does affect our present. </i>

						</li>
						<h3 class="titulo2">Used to </h3>
						<p class="general-text">The Simple Past can also be used to describe a habit which stopped in the past. In
							such situation, we can replace the Simple Past with “used to”, that is a common expression used to talk
							about habits in the past. To make it clear that we are talking about a habit, we often add expressions
							such as: always, often, usually, never, when I was a child, when I was younger etc.</p>

						<h4 class="titulo4 text-center">As the Olympics Approaches, a Lesson in Overcoming Adversity</h4>
						<p class="quote">Bert R. Mandelbaum, MD July 20, 2016</p>
						<p class="quote">
							I’ve known a lot of athletes who qualified for the Olympic Games __________ injuries. But I know of only
							one who qualified
							<i>because</i>
							of an injury.
						</p>
						<p class="quote">Cliff Meidl’s story captures the spirit of the Olympics.</p>
						<p class="quote">In November 1986, Cliff, a 20-year-old plumber’s apprentice, hit three buried
							high-voltage electrical cables with a jackhammer. An estimated 30,000 volts surged through his body,
							exploding bone and cartilage from the inside all the way up to his head. To put that into perspective,
							electric chairs use only 1500-2000 volts for executions. So it’s safe to say that Cliff should have
							died.</p>
						<p class="quote">And he nearly did. His heart stopped. Paramedics were able to get it going again, but
							they had to resuscitate him on the way to the hospital.</p>
						<p class="quote">As part of a team with renowned plastic surgeon Malcolm Lesavoy, MD, and others, I got
							to work reconstructing Cliff’s legs. Our best hope was to avoid amputation.</p>
						<p class="quote">But very quickly, we noticed something else going on – something that had nothing to
							do with our expertise. Through every step of his painful rehabilitation, Cliff grew more and more
							determined. He never complained. He just asked, “What’s next?”</p>
						<p class="quote">Before he had even finished the rehabilitation, Cliff started paddling various
							watercrafts. The days spent on crutches had already strengthened his upper body, and he took naturally
							to the sport. The same year in which he was injured, he began competing in canoe and kayak events, and
							in 1996 he qualified for the Olympics – not the Paralympic Games, the Olympic Games.
						</p>
						<p class="quote">Four years later, in Sydney, Australia, I was overseeing the sports medicine team at
							the Olympic soccer tournament. I was sitting in the stands during the opening ceremonies when Cliff
							walked into the Olympic Stadium carrying the Stars and Stripes.</p>
						<p class="quote">It’s a long-standing tradition for delegations of athletes to select one among their
							number to bear the flag, and the choice often symbolizes some extraordinary accomplishment. I had no
							idea that Cliff would be selected. So when he strode into the stadium with a normal gait, I nearly broke
							down.</p>
						<p class="quote">Moments like that reinforce what I have always believed: that sport can bring out the
							best in us all.</p>
						<p class="quote">The Olympic Games (…) are devoted to celebrating the human capacity to improve body,
							mind, and soul.</p>
						<p class="quote">They are about taking part – not necessarily about winning. Cliff’s peers in the US
							delegation of 2000 recognized that when they elected him to bear the nation’s colors. He never won a
							medal at the games, but the spirit with which he overcame adversity inspired all of them.
						</p>
						<p class="quote">
							The Olympic motto – faster, higher, stronger – can help our patients realize that the real victory is
							the “win, within”.
							<i>The Win Within: Capturing Your Victorious Spirit</i>
							is the name of the book I wrote to show people that coming back from adversity is part of our heritage –
							that we as human beings are more adapted to adversity than we are to success.
						</p>
						<p class="quote">Adversity is the engine of unimagined opportunity. It can unleash our energy and
							stimulate our will. It moves us to succeed. If I don’t have food, I have to go get some. If I’m cold, I
							have to build a shelter.</p>
						<p class="quote">I remind patients who don’t participate in sports that they have the heritage of
							athletes. We all have the genes of pursuit-hunters who survived by running down their prey and running
							away from their predators. That’s why even now, in 2016, when we go out and take a run, we feel good. We
							get an endorphin surge and our lipids go down. Our hearts and brains become clear.</p>
						<p class="quote">The life of sport and sport of life are interlinked. Exercise is our birthright; it’s
							our legacy; it’s why we are here.</p>
						<p class="quote">We no longer have to fear saber-toothed tigers or cave bears. But when you look today
							at how people can be successful in 2016, it’s by avoiding the predators in our urban life: overeating,
							inactivity, and smoking. And it’s by rising to meet adversity.</p>

						<h4 class="titulo4 text-center">Which skin colour are you? The human swatch chart that confronts racism
						</h4>
						<p class="quote">
							In 1933, in a book called
							<i>The Masters and the Slaves</i>
							, the Brazilian anthropologist Gilberto Freyre wrote: “Every Brazilian, even the light-skinned,
							fair-haired one, carries about him on his soul, when not on soul and body alike, the shadow, or at least
							the birthmark, of the aborigine or the negro.” This was forefront in the mind of the French artist
							Pierre David when he moved to Brazil in 2009. “When I was in the streets, I could see so many skin
							colours”, he says. He decided to make a human colour chart, like one you would find in the paint section
							of B&Q shop, but showing the gradations and shades of our skin colour. The project, called Nuancier or
							“swatches”, was first shown at the Museu de Arte Moderna in Salvador – Bahia, and is now on show in his
							native France. “Brazil has a better attitude to skin colour than other developed nations”, he says.
							“There’s no doubt, because the concept of skin colour difference was recognised very early in their
							history. Now, it even appears on identity documents.”
						</p>
						<p class="quote">Yet Nuancier, David says, is still a critique of racism, in Brazil and around the
							world. “This work may seem provocative – to classify men by colour, to industrially produce the colour
							of an individual so it can be store-bought. But this is a demonstration of the commodification of
							bodies. It denounces racism anywhere it is found in the world.”</p>

						<h4 class="titulo4 text-center">What is Gentrification?</h4>
						<p class="quote">Gentrification is a general term for the arrival of higher-income people in an
							existing working-class urban district, causing a related increase in rents and property values, and
							changes in the district’s character and culture. The term is often used negatively, suggesting the
							displacement of low-income communities by affluent outsiders. But the effects of gentrification are
							complex and contradictory, and its real impact varies.</p>
						<p class="quote">Many aspects of the gentrification process are desirable. Who wouldn’t want to see
							reduced crime, new investment in buildings and infrastructure, and increased economic activity in their
							neighborhoods? Unfortunately, the benefits of these changes are often enjoyed disproportionately by the
							new arrivals, while the established residents find themselves economically and socially marginalized.
						</p>
						<p class="quote">Although there is not a clear-cut technical definition of gentrification, it is
							characterized by several changes:</p>
						<p class="quote">• Demographics: An increase in median income, a decline in the proportion of ethnic
							minorities, and a reduction in household size, as low-income families are replaced by young singles and
							couples.</p>
						<p class="quote">• Real estate markets: Large increases in rents and home prices, increases in the
							number of evictions, conversion of rental units to ownership (condos) and new development of luxury
							housing.</p>
						<p class="quote">• Land use: A decline in industrial uses, an increase in office or multimedia uses,
							the development of live-work “lofts” and high-end housing, retail, and restaurants.</p>
						<p class="quote">• Culture and character: New ideas about what is desirable and attractive, including
							standards (either informal or legal) for architecture, landscaping, public behavior, noise, and
							nuisance.</p>
