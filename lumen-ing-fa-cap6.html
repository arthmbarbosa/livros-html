							What were you doing when you heard an English word for the first time? When and where did you speak your
							first sentence in this language? There is a slight chance you will remember such specific information, but
							you may remember your first English teacher, a nursery rhyme you learned as a kid, or even the lines of
							your most beloved movie or song in English. And so could possibly do the 378 million native speakers and
							the 743 million people around the globe who speak English as a second language. Considering there are
							approximately 7 billion people in the world, this is relevant data.</p>
						<p class="general-text">
							Currently, people who use English as their mother tongue make up less than 10% of the world’s population;
							nevertheless, in terms of the quantity of transmitted information, English is the leader by far.
							Throughout the world, it is studied as a foreign language and employed by a majority of Internet users,
							used in most movies both in original recording or subtitles, and found in music, broadcasting, technical
							and scientific periodicals. </p>
						<p class="general-text">
							It is known that a working knowledge of English is required in many fields and occupations, and that’s why
							teaching English at least at a basic level is mandatory in a variety of countries. Due to globalization,
							e-mail exchanges, meetings and negotiations are mostly performed in English. Therefore, speaking the
							language can be a breakthrough for career growth, or even for getting a job, either in national or
							international companies. If you were thinking about improving your skills but weren’t feeling inspired, we
							hope you change your mind and find a connection with this powerful international language.</p>

							On many suspense movies, when a crime has been committed and the detectives or officers need to
							investigate suspects in order to find out if they have alibis, they ask questions such as the following:

						</p>
						<img class="img-full-width" src="./assets/img/what_wer.png"></img>

						<p class="general-text">We use the Past Continuous tense (also called Past Progressive tense) to describe an
							action that was in progress in the past. When we use the Past Continuous tense, our listener usually knows
							or understands what time we are talking about. The answer for the previous question, for example, could
							be:</p>

						<img class="img-full-width" src="./assets/img/i_wad.png"></img>

						<p class="general-text">
							We often use the Past Continuous tense to “set the scene” in stories. We use it to describe the background
							situation that was happening when the action began. Often, the story starts with the Past Continuous tense
							and then moves into the Past Simple tense. Here is an example:
						</p>

						<h3 class="titulo2">
							Verb “be” for the Past Continuous
						</h3>

						<p class="general-text">The structure of the Past Continuous is always: was/were + verb + -ing.</p>
						<p class="general-text">It is always good to remind you that we use was with the pronouns I / he / she / it
							and were with the pronouns we / you / they.</p>
						<p class="general-text">

							Repetition and irritation with “always”
						</h3>

						<p class="general-text">
							The Past Continuous with words such as “always” or “constantly” expresses the idea of something irritating
							or shocking that was happening in the past, and it shows a negative emotion. Remember: the words “always”
							or “constantly” go between “be” and “verb + -ing.”

						<p class="quote">A Parisian book fair’s promotion of Globish may have sparked outrage among critics, but
							it’s not the first time the French have promoted simplified English.
						<p>
						<p class="quote">French writers were up in arms this week after the Salon du Livre book fair in Paris
							announced a celebration of young adult books that would feature a “Bookroom”, a “Photobooth”, and even a
							“Bookquizz”, a prospect so exciting it needs two zs. Such anglicisms, critics wrote, were an
							“unconscionable act of cultural vandalism”, employing the “sub-English known as Globish”.
						<p>
						<p class="quote">It is a lamentable irony, then, that Globish has been so energetically popularised by a
							Frenchman. In 2004, the former IBM executive Jean-Paul Nerrière began selling his system of simplified
							English (only 1,500 words) to students around the world. (Globish is a portmanteau of “globe” and
							“English”.) The earliest attested use of the term, however, described in 1997 a more natural linguistic
							hybridisation of various “non-western forms of English” that had become just as “creative and lively” as
							the standard tongue.
						<p>
						<p class="quote-source">“‘Globish’: why France has a love-hate relationship with global English”. The
							Guardian, February 8th, 2019. Available at:

							Copyright Guardian News & Media Ltd 2019.</p>
						<p class="general-text">“Globish” is therefore both a trademark for one man’s singular vision of
							international communication, and a way of describing the branching of English into multiple exotic
							planetary species. But the literary Parisians see it simply as yet more Anglo-Saxon cultural imperialism.
							Well, as the French do sometimes say, c’est la life.</p>

						<p>
						<p class="quote">Nerrière doesn’t see Globish in the same light as utopian efforts such as Kosmos,
							Volapuk, Novial or staunch Esperanto. Nor should it be confused with barbaric Algol (for Algorithmic
