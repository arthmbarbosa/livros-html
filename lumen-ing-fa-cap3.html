						<p class="general-text">The impacts of the past are evident in Brazil, manifested through the diversity and
							abundance
							of cultural, social, economic and many other aspects of our current society. Such diversity has influenced
							a wide range of expressions, such as dance, music, religion, cooking and language, and these contributions
							affect our own lifestyle until today, as our ancestral culture is registered in our DNA and in our
							history.</p>
						<p class="general-text">Our country is recognized worldwide for our historical and cultural roots, but
							soccer is,
							without a doubt, one of the most striking reasons, even though it only dates back to the 19th century.
							Maybe you will be surprised to hear that we have inherited our most beloved passion from England. It is
							said that the Brazilian Charles Miller, who lived in Brazil with other English immigrants, brought the
							sport from a trip to Britain, in 1885.</p>
						<p class="general-text">
							Another example of the Brazilian cultural wealth is the
							<i>roda de capoeira</i>
							, which is considered an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by Unesco. Sometimes referred to as a
							martial art, other times as a dance, and yet other times as a game, capoeira is said to have been first
							created during the 16th century by people who were forced to leave West Africa to come to Brazil and work
							as slaves. It came to life as a survival tool, not only of self-defense, but also of cultural identity.
						</p>
						<p class="general-text">We could go on and on listing examples of how past behaviors and actions affect our
							lives, but
							what is important to acknowledge is that getting to know where we came from has not only historical but
							also moral value. Once we study our past, we tend to open our minds and exercise empathy, which prepares
							us to live more humanely and respectfully.</p>

						<p class="general-text">
							The irregular verbs do not follow the general rule of using -

						<img class="img-md" src="./assets/img/our_ancestors.png"></img>

						<p class="general-text">
							There are about 200 irregular verbs in English, and a good way to learn them is to study them in separated

						<h3 class="titulo2">Adverbs of sequence</h3>
						<p class="general-text">We use the Simple Past to talk about past events. And to help us do that in a more

							We can start the description of a past event using
							<b>first</b>
							, continue with
							<b>then</b>

							<b>afterwards</b>

							<b>after</b>
							<b>that</b>

						<p class="general-text">Memorizing the list of irregular verbs may not be as effective as learning them.
							Here are some strategies to help you:</p>
						<li class="general-text"> Make cards to test yourself – put the infinitive on one side and the past on the

						</li>
						<li class="general-text"> Write sentences with different verbs in them. </li>
						<li class="general-text"> Keep a diary in English and write down a few things you did every day.</li>
						<li class="general-text"> Practice with online activities. </li>
						<li class="general-text"> Read a graded reader in English. Books are full of verbs in their past forms, so
							reading is
							a really useful way to practice and review.</li>
						<li class="general-text"> Watch movies and listen to music, pay attention to the use of Simple Past and

							irregular verbs.</li>
						<li class="general-text"> Make your own verb list.</li>
