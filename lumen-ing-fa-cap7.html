						<p class="general-text">The history of the English language learning in Brazil dates back to 1837, when it
							started to be taught in schools with French and Latin. French importance and prestige were much greater at
							the time, though, due to its influence in our culture and science. However, since the 1920s, due to spoken
							movies, and after World War II, as a result of trade and political agreements between USA and Brazil,
							along with the spread of American culture and way of life, the need and desire to speak English have
							increased. </p>
						<p class="general-text">Currently the search for English proficiency has been intensified by the need to
							communicate across cultures. Fortunately, the access to learning English is easier and not as expensive as
							it was decades ago, now that, with the advent of the Internet, one can complement the studies from regular
							schools using apps, chatting on social networks, listening to music or watching stream TV, everything
							online from home. </p>
						<p class="general-text">Even so, Brazil still has to break new ground in the interest of English teaching.
							There is a lot to improve in foreign language education at the elementary and secondary school levels, so
							that your generation has better opportunities in the global economy. It is up to you and your peers to put
							effort into the process and change this reality as soon as possible.</p>

							<h3 class="titulo1">Present and Past tenses</h3>
						</div>

						<p class="general-text">Verb tenses tell us how an action relates to the flow of time. There are three main
							verb tenses in English: present, past and future. The present, past and future tenses are divided into
							four aspects: simple, progressive, perfect, and perfect progressive. </p>
						<p class="general-text">Only in the past and the present it is possible to form a tense from the verb alone.
							For example, “we ate”, and “we eat”. To form other verb tenses, you have to add auxiliary verbs, such as
							“have”, “be” or “will” before the main verbs. </p>
						<p class="general-text">It may take a while for English learners to master verb tenses, but practice makes
							perfect! One special hint for you: adverbs of time offer valuable clues about the correct verb tense to be
							used. For instance, “ago” is only used with the Simple Past (“My first English class was 7 months ago”),
							so every time it shows up, you know the action started and finished in the past. This is valuable
							information for when you are answering comprehension questions about a text, for example.</p>

						<h3 class="titulo2">
							Present tenses
						</h3>
						<p class="general-text">The present tenses in English are the Simple Present, the Present Continuous, the
							Present Perfect, and the Present Perfect Continuous. We can also use the Future Simple and Continuous to
							make assumptions about something happening in the present.</p>


						<h3 class="titulo3">
							The Simple Present
						</h3>
						<p class="general-text">
							The base form of a verb tells you that the action is in the present tense. As studied before, the base
							form of a verb takes an
							<b>s</b>
							after it (sometimes an
							<b>es</b>
							or
							<b>ies</b>
							) when the subject of the verb – the person or thing performing the action – is a third person pronoun
							(“she”, “he” or “it”). Additionally, the plain form also takes an
							<b>s</b>
							when the subject of the sentence is a singular noun.
						</p>
						<p class="general-text">We use this tense to describe actions that take place as a routine or habit, and
							also to talk about generalizations and permanent states. </p>

						<div class="blue-box">
							<p class="general-text">
								The students <b>take up</b> conversation classes with
								Ms. Klein twice a week.
							</p>
						</div>

						<div class="blue-box">
							<span>
								Adrien <b>studies</b> hard for the final exams because
								he wants to study English abroad.
							</span>

						</div>

						<h3 class="titulo3">
							The Present Continuous
						</h3>
						<p class="general-text">
							The continuous tenses show an action that is, was, or will be in progress at a certain time. They are
							formed with the verb
							<b>be</b>
							+ the
							<b>-ing</b>
							form of the verb. The Present Continuous tense can be used to show that an action is happening at the
							moment of speaking, but we can also use it to describe a temporary action that is currently taking place,
							but necessarily while we are speaking. We can infer that the action takes place at a moment in time and
							that it is going to finish.

						</div>

						<h2 class="titulo2">
							Past tenses
						</h2>
						<p class="general-text">The past tenses in English are the Simple Past, the Past Continuous, the Past
							Perfect, and the Past Perfect Continuous. </p>
						<h3 class="titulo3">
							The Simple Past
						</h3>
						<p class="general-text">We use the Simple Past to talk about actions that started and finished at a definite
							time in the past. For example, when you and your family are having dinner and sharing what happened in
							your day, you are likely to use it.</p>
						<p class="general-text">
							We usually add the
							<b>-ed</b>
							suffix to form the past of regular verbs. Irregular verbs, however, do not end in
							<b>-ed</b>
							in the past tense, taking on different forms, and the best way to learn them is by getting familiar with
							them (through reading, listening to music, watching films, practicing, etc.).
						</p>
						<div class="blue-box">
							<span>
								I <b>arrived</b> at school at 8 am. I <b>waited</b> for the teacher
								and the class started. After school I <b>ate</b> with my friend
								Veronica, we <b>had</b> spaghetti. In the afternoon we
								<b>worked</b> on the Portuguese project. It <b>was</b> a busy day!
							</span>
						</div>
						<h3 class="titulo3">
							<b>The Past Continuous</b>
						</h3>
						<p class="general-text">We use the Past Continuous to show that an action was happening at a certain moment
							in the past. </p>
						<div class="blue-box">
							<span>
								Liz <b>was doing</b> her listening activities last night, that’s
								why she didn’t pick up the phone.
							</span>
						</div>
						<p class="general-text">
							The Past Continuous is also used to describe an action that was happening when another action, usually
							shorter, happened at the same time, interrupted the continuous action or started after it. We normally use
							<b>when</b>
							and
							<b>while</b>
							with this verb tense:

						<p class="quote">Alberto Santos Dumont (1873-1932) was born in Brazil and educated in Paris. He made his
							first balloon ascent in 1898 and, soon after that, began constructing dirigible airships. In 1901 he won a
							Paris air race and international fame. (After the race, he asked Louis Cartier for a timepiece that would
							keep his hands free – the first wristwatch.)</p>
						<p class="quote">Turning to heavier-than-air machines, Santos Dumont built his 14-Bis in 1906, three
							years after the Wright brothers’ initial flight. His flight was the first in Europe, and his plane was the
							first anywhere to lift off the ground under its own power. In 1909 Santos Dumont designed the Demoiselle
							monoplane, the first modern light plane.</p>
						<p class="quote">In 1901 Santos Dumont fell ill with multiple sclerosis and retired from flying. He
							returned to Brazil in 1916. Ill and despondent over the use of aircraft in warfare, he committed suicide
							in 1932.</p>

						<h4 class="titulo4 text-center">Reading the world in 196 books</h4>
						<p class="quote-source">By Ann Morgan (Photo: Darren Russell) – BBC – 15 July 2013</p>
						<p class="quote">I used to think of myself as a fairly cosmopolitan sort of person, but my bookshelves
							told a different story. Apart from a few Indian novels and the odd Australian and South African book, my
							literature collection consisted of British and American titles. Worse still, I hardly ever tackled
							anything in translation. My reading was confined to stories by English-speaking authors.
						</p>
						<p class="quote">So, at the start of 2012, I set myself the challenge of trying to read a book from
							every country (well, all 195 United Nations (UN) recognised states plus former UN member Taiwan) in a
							year to find out what I was missing. With no idea how to go about this beyond a sneaking suspicion that
							I was unlikely to find publications from nearly 200 nations on the shelves of my local bookshop, I
							decided to ask the planet’s readers for help. I created a blog called A Year of Reading the World and
							put out an appeal for suggestions of titles that I could read in English.</p>
						<p class="quote">The response was amazing. Before I knew it, people all over the planet were getting in
							touch with ideas and offers of help. Some posted me books from their home countries. Others did hours of
							research on my behalf. In addition, several writers, like Turkmenistan’s Ak Welsapar and Panama’s Juan
							David Morgan, sent me unpublished translations of their novels, giving me a rare opportunity to read
							works otherwise unavailable to the 62% of Brits who only speak English. Even with such an extraordinary
							team of bibliophiles behind me, however, sourcing books was no easy task. For a start, with translations
							making up only around 4.5 per cent of literary works published in the UK and Ireland, getting English
							versions of stories was tricky. </p>
						<p class="quote">But the effort was worth it. As I made my way through the planet’s literary
							landscapes, extraordinary things started to happen. In the hands of gifted writers, I discovered
							bookpacking offered something a physical traveller could hope to experience only rarely: it took me
							inside the thoughts of individuals living far away and showed me the world through their eyes. More
							powerful than a thousand news reports, these stories not only opened my mind to the nuts and bolts of
							life in other places, but opened my heart to the way people there might feel. </p>
						<p class="quote">And that in turn changed my thinking. Through reading the stories shared with me by
							bookish strangers around the globe, I realised I was not an isolated person, but part of a network that
							stretched all over the planet. One by one, the country names on the list that had begun as an
							intellectual exercise at the</p>
						<p class="quote">start of the year transformed into vital, vibrant places filled with laughter, love,
							anger, hope and fear. Lands that had once seemed exotic and remote became close and familiar to me –
							places I could identify with. At its best, I learned, fiction makes the world real.
